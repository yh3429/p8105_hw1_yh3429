# Problem 1

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

## Mean of flipper length

``` r
mean_flipper_length= mean(penguins$flipper_length_mm,na.rm = TRUE)  
```

## Description of dataset

A short description of the penguins dataset: This is the penguins
dataset. The important variables’ names include species, island,
bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm, flipper_length_mm,body_mass_g, sex, and
year. There are 344 rows and 8 columns in the dataset (344 observations
of 8 variables). The mean flipper length = 200.92

## Scatterplot

``` r
  ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm))+ geom_point(aes(color=species))
```

This is the scatterplot of flipper_length_mm (y) vs bill_length_mm (x);
color points using the species variable.

# Problem 2

## Data frame

``` r
p2_df = tibble(
  vec_numeric = rnorm (10),
  vec_logical = vec_numeric > 0,
  vec_char = rep(c("A","B","C"), length=10),
  vec_factor = factor(rep(c("small","medium","large"), length=10))
)
```

## Mean of data

``` r
mean_vec_numeric = mean (pull(p2_df, vec_numeric), na.rm=TRUE)
mean_vec_logical = mean (pull(p2_df, vec_logical), na.rm=TRUE)
mean_vec_char = mean (pull(p2_df, vec_char), na.rm=TRUE)
mean_vec_factor = mean (pull(p2_df, vec_factor), na.rm=TRUE)
```

Based on the results, only numeric vector and logical vector can be
cconvert_vec_charalculated the mean value. The character vector and
factor vector cannot be calculated the mean value.

## Convert vector type

``` r
convert_vec_logical= as.numeric (pull(p2_df, vec_logical))
convert_vec_char= as.numeric (pull(p2_df, vec_char))
convert_vec_factor= as.numeric (pull(p2_df, vec_factor))
```

The logical vector and factor vector can be converted but the character
vector cannot be converted.

Yes. It helps to explain what happens when trying to take the mean. For
the logical vector, it is still reasonable for the values which
converting to numeric variable, which is “1” recognized as “True” and
“0” recognized as “False”. So, its mean can be calculated. For the
factor vector, it is not meaningful for the values which converting to
numeric variable. So, its mean cannot be calculated. For the character
vector, it even cannot be converted into numeric. So, its mean cannot be
calculated.
